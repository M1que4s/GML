# GML

GTK Mockup Metalanguage (GML for simplicity) is an attempt to replace the XML used in GTK templates.

### *"Why?"*

Honestly, I think it's a pain in the \*ss to create GTK templates with XML. Also, the current syntax for templates has poor readability, so it's easy to get lost if you create the templates by hand.

### *"How does it work?*

You write your templates in GML and then compile them into the usual XML used by GTK.
